# This is a personal project created with ReactJS and SWAPI

The site allows you to browse SWAPI's data in a sequential manner, with a clean UI.
I used ReactJS as the UI framework, which allowed for flexibility with data and cleaner code.
Axios was used for data fetching.

https://swapi.dev is the API i used originally but it crashed midway. I found a mirror at https://swapi.py4e.com/ , thanks to a github issue forum.

If you want to try out the code, all you have to do is **clone the repo** and:

```
cd sw-app
npm start
```
